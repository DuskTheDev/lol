        <p><strong>Script:</strong> "One of my main goals this semester was to improve my study habits and stay organized with assignments and exams.

        <p>"To address this, I created a weekly schedule and used a planner to keep track of important dates allongside making a small website just for me. I focused on prioritizing tasks based on deadlines and allowed myself short breaks to recharge. Although my system isn’t perfect yet, it’s been a big help for managing my workload and staying on top of my everything."</p>
        <p>"Looking to next semester, I plan to refine this strategy even further by adding buffer time around big projects and exams, as I have found that I am a bit of a procrastinator. Having a bit of extra time will help me handle unexpected issues and work at a slower, more relaxing pace"</p>
