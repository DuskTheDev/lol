        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p><strong>Attention Grabber:</strong> What happens when AI tries to learn from itself without any human input? Let me show you.</p>
        <p class="slide-change">(SLIDE 2)</p>
        <p>What you’re looking at here is what happens when an AI model, like Stable Diffusion, is trained over and over on its own outputs. Without fresh human-generated input, the results become distorted, incoherent, and kind of creepy.</p>
        <p>This visual reminds us: no matter how advanced AI becomes, it can’t function effectively without us.</p>
        <p><strong>Context:</strong></p>
        <p class="slide-change">(SLIDE 3)</p>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence really is one of the biggest topics of the 2020s. I think we can all agree that the speed at which this technology is growing is fast—really fast. Some models seem smarter than humans, and headlines often claim AI is "taking over the world."</p>
        <p><strong>Ethos Establisher:</strong> My name is Weston, and at the start of the semester during our brown bag speech, I mentioned my interest in computers and programming. I’ve personally trained and worked on AI models. My main project, SkyEye, is an image identification model that identifies airplane types through images. I’ve seen firsthand AI’s power, but also its limitations. Artificial Intelligence can do incredible things, but it cannot replace us.</p>
        <p><strong>Thesis and Listener Link:</strong> Today, I’ll argue that humans are irreplaceable to AI because of three main points:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We provide the data it learns from.</li>
            <li>We supply the innovation it lacks.</li>
            <li>We guide it ethically.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As college students preparing to enter a workforce or already in a field shaped by AI, this topic matters to all of us.</p>

    <!-- First Main Point -->
    <section class="slide" id="main-point-1">
        <h3>First Main Point: Humans Supply the Data</h3>
        <p class="slide-change">(SLIDE 4)</p>
        <p><strong>Subpoint 1:</strong> AI relies on human-generated data. AI is essentially a system of mathematical equations that learns patterns from data. Neural networks, its cutting-edge architecture, are just digital emulations of brains.</p>
        <p>Here’s the catch: the data AI uses is almost always created, curated, and labeled by humans. Data represents history—it’s a record of what’s happened, not a map of the future. AI makes predictions based only on past trends.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A Microsoft Research report highlights, "Overreliance on AI occurs when users start accepting incorrect AI outputs. This leads to errors that erode trust in AI systems."</p>
        <p><strong>Subpoint 2:</strong> Biased or incomplete data cripples AI. Imagine training an AI to recognize airplanes. You’d need thousands of labeled images. If your data is biased—say it only includes private jets—the AI will fail to recognize commercial planes.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> An AP report warns, “AI is expected to exhaust human-written text for training data by 2026.” Without fresh human input, AI stagnates.</p>
        <p><strong>Survey Connection:</strong> Seven out of 14 respondents recognized that humans are essential to AI’s success, showing that this is a critical issue to address.</p>
        <p class="slide-change">(SLIDE 5)</p>
        <p><strong>Transition:</strong> But what about creativity? Some argue AI is already capable of true innovation. Let’s explore that idea.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Second Main Point -->
    <section class="slide" id="main-point-2">
        <h3>Second Main Point: Humans Drive Innovation</h3>
        <p><strong>Subpoint 1:</strong> AI is not innovative; it remixes. Language models like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, or Mixtral can write essays, while art models like Midjourney create stunning visuals.</p>
        <p>In our survey, four respondents believed AI is “definitely” creative. But as Francis Gobet and Giovanni Sala explain in Frontiers, “AI is a tool for creativity, but the spark of originality lies with humans.” AI can refine and remix, but it cannot invent something groundbreaking.</p>
        <p class="slide-change">(SLIDE 6)</p>
        <p><strong>Subpoint 2:</strong> Innovation requires human experience. Creativity involves abstract thought, emotion, and intuition—things AI lacks. Take music generation, for example. AI can compose a song in the style of Mozart, but it cannot create new genres like jazz or hip-hop.</p>
        <p>Think about your own field of study or profession: Could AI really create something groundbreaking? Or would it need humans to guide and inspire it?</p>
        <p><strong>Transition:</strong> Even if AI could create, can it judge the ethics of its creations? That’s where humans are irreplaceable.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Third Main Point -->
    <section class="slide" id="main-point-3">
        <h3>Third Main Point: Humans Ensure Ethical Use</h3>
        <p class="slide-change">(SLIDE 7)</p>
        <p><strong>Subpoint 1:</strong> AI doesn’t understand ethics. It can’t distinguish right from wrong. Example: Doctors use AI for diagnoses, but their expertise ensures patients receive the best care.</p>
        <p><strong>Subpoint 2:</strong> Unchecked AI leads to harm. Survey respondents raised concerns about unethical uses of AI, such as deepfakes. One respondent said, "The unethical dark side of fabricated information and images."</p>
        <p><strong>Transition:</strong> So, whether it’s providing data, inspiring innovation, or ensuring ethical use, AI depends on us at every step. Let’s bring it all together.</p>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <section class="slide" id="conclusion">
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="slide-change">(SLIDE 9)</p>
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Today, I’ve shown how AI relies on humans for data, innovation, and ethical judgment. These aren’t just technical issues—they’re deeply human ones.</p>
        <p class="slide-change">(SLIDE 10)</p>
        <p><strong>Clincher:</strong> Remember this distorted image from earlier? Without us, AI is incoherent. With us, it’s a tool to shape the future. Let’s ensure we stay in the driver’s seat.</p>
